## Data wrangling: WeRateDogs and what to find out about it

### Date created
2021-03-23

### Description
This is a small project to practice my data wrangling skills. I gather data
from the Twitter account WeRateDogs to gain some insights into this popular
Twitter account. Some of the data is provided by Udacity (see Credits), while I
also use the Twitter API and Tweepy to gather data on the retweet rate and popularity
of the account's posts. \
After gathering the data, the main part of the project consists of assessing and
cleaning the data. A short report is also included.

### Credits
The Twitter archive of the WeRateDogs account as well as the image recognition
data was provided by the Udacity course "Data Analyst Nanodegree".
